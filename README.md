# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is tic tac toe pretty standard. I implmented minimax algorithim but I did something wrong and the AI isn't winning everytime like it's supposed to and I'm too lazy to fix it. It knows how to win and makes moves in order to win however sometimes it doesn't make right moves so just pretend it's a medium level AI yes definetly on purpose. Maybe one day I will fix it.
